# FunProjectsWebsite
Small website to explore fun, little ideas 

TO DO:
- Look into automatically updating pictures/quotes at a less-active time in the future
- Images are too restricted by the default bootstrap config and are often too small
- Being able to navigate by id number, GET request?
- Randomize button for image/quote, randomize on page load
