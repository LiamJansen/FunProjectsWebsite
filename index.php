                        My name is Liam and I'm currently searching for a software developer position.
                        <br><br>
                        I've created this little website for some of my personal stuff to have fun with.
                        <br>
                        There are pictures of beautiful landscapes, amazing original art or fanart of shows and films and epic structures to name a few examples.
                        <br>
                        There is also the quotes section where I've added quotes that inspire me or I think are just plain cool. These are from various media such as books or films, or just randomly found on the internet.
                        <br>
                        In the future I might add stories or drawings that I'm willing to make public.
